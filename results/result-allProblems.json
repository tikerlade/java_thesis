I/O resources checked by this inspection include `java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.OutputStream`, `java.io.Reader`, `java.io.Writer`, `java.util.zip.ZipFile`, `java.io.Closeable` and `java.io.RandomAccessFile`.\n\n\nI/O resources wrapped by other I/O resources are not reported, as the wrapped resource will be closed by the wrapping resource.\n\n\nBy default, the inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with\n'close' or 'cleanup' in its name.\n\n**Example:**\n\n\n      void save() throws IOException {\n        FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"filename.txt\"); //warning\n        writer.write(\"sample\");\n      }\n\n\nUse the following options to configure the inspection:\n\n* List I/O resource classes that do not need to be closed and should be ignored by this inspection.\n* Whether an I/O resource is allowed to be opened inside a `try`block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a `try` block.\n* Whether the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.",

You can also configure nullability annotations using the **Configure Annotations** button.\n* Use the **Treat non-annotated members and parameters as @Nullable** option to assume that non-annotated members can be null, so they must not be used in non-null context.\n* Use the **Report not-null required parameter with null-literal argument usages** option to report method parameters that cannot be null (e.g. immediately dereferenced in the method body), but there are call sites where a `null` literal is passed.\n* Use the **Report nullable methods that always return a non-null value** option to report methods that are annotated as `@Nullable`, but always return non-null value.

If the option is enabled, the assertions will be completely ignored (-da mode).\n* Use the **Warn when reading a value guaranteed to be constant** option to add warnings on reading variables that contain some constant values, for example: `true`, `false`, or `null`.\n* Use the **Report problems that happen only on some code paths** option to control whether to report problems that may happen only on some code path. If this option is disabled, warnings like *exception is possible* will not be reported. The inspection will report only warnings like *exception will definitely occur*.
